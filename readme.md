## How UX Components works ?

The UX Components bundle contains many default settings for layout and components.

Each of the parameters can be overloaded in 2 ways:
- overloaded by the ux.yaml configuration file
- overloaded by SCSS variable definition

> Higher priority is given to SCSS variables
